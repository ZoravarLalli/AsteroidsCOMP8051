Note:
When checking contributions in the insights tab, the commit count is inaccurate, likely due to how git on MacOs by default commits under the MacOS user and not the GitHub account.

Commits can be still be seen [here](https://github.com/ZoravarLalli/AsteroidsCOMP8051/commits/master), but half of Jason's commits show up as socas's and all of Zora's commits show up Hoang-Yen Chung's commits. kolsson3 is Kris.
